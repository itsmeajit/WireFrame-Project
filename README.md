# WireFrame-Project
SWE Project

This was a goup project for software engineering course

A wireframe is a basic, two-dimensional visual representation of a web page, app interface, 
or product layout. You can think of it as a low-fidelity, functional sketch. ... It's why most 
wireframes look simple: grayscale instead of colors, placeholders for images, and Lorem 
Ipsum for text. Wireframe is commonly used to layout content and functionality on a page 
which takes into account user needs and user journeys. Wireframes are used early in the 
development process to establish the basic structure of a page before visual design and 
content is added
